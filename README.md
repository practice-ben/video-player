# Video Player
This is a web app created in React. I used plain css to style the app. This was part of an exercise by freeCodeCamp's article on seven react projects for 2023.
## Challenges faced 
The main challenge faced in this project was creating an autoplay video element and initializing a video on window refresh/reload. 
To overcome this challenge, I researched about the attributes of a video element in HTML and I added the controls and autoplay attributes. I also initialized state with a pre-selected video.
